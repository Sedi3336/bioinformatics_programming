calculate_avg_value function gets a dictionary of four columns as data and a string to match with the columnâ€™s name and calculate the average value for that column.

find_average_wines function takes some csv file paths in a list as input.
Then it reads each csv file individually and creates a dictionary(header_value) of that csv file.
In this dictionary, the key is csv's column names and the values are the corresponding values in each column of the csv file.
Then this function sends those dictionaries to the calculate_avg_value function and generates a new dictionary( header_avg ) out of the average values for each column.
At the end, another dictionary (result) is made with the key of wine_paths ( each csv file) and a value of the last dictionary (header_avg) and returns it.
